# hpegl Provider

This is the hpegl (HPE GreenLake) terraform provider for use in managing HPE GreenLake
services.  The VMaaS service is currently supported.

Note that a service-client must be used with this provider.  For information on how to
create a service-client see [here]().

The following env-vars can be used to supply service-client creds and related information to
the provider:

```bash
export HPEGL_TENANT_ID=< tenant-id >
export HPEGL_USER_ID=< service client id >
export HPEGL_USER_SECRET=< service client secret >
export HPEGL_IAM_SERVICE_URL=< GL iam service url, defaults to https://client.greenlake.hpe.com/api/iam >
```


## Example Usage

```terraform
