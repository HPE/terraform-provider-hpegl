# hpegl Provider

This is the hpegl (HPE GreenLake) terraform provider for use in managing HPE GreenLake
services.  The VMaaS service is currently supported.

Note that a service-client must be used with this provider.  For information on how to
create a service-client see [here]().

The following env-vars can be used to supply service-client creds and related information to
the provider:

```bash
export HPEGL_TENANT_ID=< tenant-id >
export HPEGL_USER_ID=< service client id >
export HPEGL_USER_SECRET=< service client secret >
export HPEGL_IAM_SERVICE_URL=< the "issuer" URL for the service client  >
```


## Example Usage

```terraform
# Copyright 2020 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP

# Set-up for terraform >= v0.13
terraform {
  required_providers {
    hpegl = {
      source  = "hewlettpackard/hpegl"
      version = ">= 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "hpegl" {
  # Provide vmaas block if you want to create vmaas resources
  vmaas {
    location   = "location"
    space_name = "space_name"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- **api_vended_service_client** (Boolean) Declare if the service-client being used is an API-vended one or not.  Defaults to "true"
            i.e. the client is API-vended.  The value can be set using the HPEGL_API_VENDED_SERVICE_CLIENT env-var.
- **iam_service_url** (String) The IAM service URL to be used to generate tokens.  In the case of API-vended service clients
            (the default) then this should be set to the "issuer url" for the client.  In the case of non-API-vended
            service clients use the appropriate GL "client" URL. Can be set by HPEGL_IAM_SERVICE_URL env-var
- **iam_token** (String) The IAM token to be used with the client(s).  Note that in normal operation
                a service client is used.  Passing-in a token means that tokens will not be generated or refreshed.
- **tenant_id** (String) The tenant-id to be used, can be set by HPEGL_TENANT_ID env-var
- **user_id** (String) The user id to be used, can be set by HPEGL_USER_ID env-var
- **user_secret** (String) The user secret to be used, can be set by HPEGL_USER_SECRET env-var
- **vmaas** (Block Set, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--vmaas))
