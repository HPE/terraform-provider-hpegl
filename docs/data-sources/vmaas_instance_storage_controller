# Data-source hpegl_vmaas_instance_storage_controller

The hpegl_vmaas_instance_storage_controller data source can be used to discover the ID of a storage controller mount.
		This can then be used with resources or data sources that require a hpegl_vmaas_instance_disk_type,
		such as the hpegl_vmaas_instance resource.

## Example usage

```terraform
# (C) Copyright 2024 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP

data "hpegl_vmaas_instance_storage_controller" "scsi_0" {
  layout_id        = data.hpegl_vmaas_layout.vmware.id
  controller_name  = "SCSI VMware Paravirtual"
  bus_number       = 0
  interface_number = 0
}
```

- During volume addition for an instance, if the interface or bus details are wrong, then TF will exit with VM as unknow state.
- During creation of an instance, the first volume will always be `SCSI VMware Paravirtual - SCSI 0:0`.
- Controller of a created volume cannot be modified. But volume can be deleted and re-created with correct virtual adaptor info.
