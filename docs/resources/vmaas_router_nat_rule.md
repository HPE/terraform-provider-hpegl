# Resource hpegl_vmaas_router_nat_rule

Router NAT rule resource facilitates creating,
		updating and deleting NSX-T Network Router NAT rules.
`hpegl_vmaas_router_nat_rule` resource supports NSX-T network router NAT rule creation.

For creating an NSX-T network router NAT rule, please refer following examples.

## Example usage for creating NSX-T Network router NAT rule with all possible attributes

```terraform
# (C) Copyright 2021 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP

resource "hpegl_vmaas_router_nat_rule" "tf_nat" {
  name        = "tf_nat_rule"
  router_id   = data.hpegl_vmaas_router.tf_router.id
  enabled     = true
  description = "NAT rule created via terraform"
  config {
    action   = "DNAT"
    logging  = true
    firewall = "MATCH_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS"
  }
  source_network      = "1.1.3.0/24"
  translated_network  = "1.1.1.0/24"
  destination_network = "1.1.2.0/24"
  translated_ports    = 22
  priority            = 120
}
```

-> `destination_network` should be set when `action` is set to `DNAT`. Similarly `source_network`
should be set when `action` is set to `SNAT`.
