# Resource hpegl_vmaas_load_balancer_monitor

-> Compatible version >= 5.4.6

Loadbalancer Monitor resource facilitates creating, updating
		and deleting NSX-T Network Load Balancer Monitors.
`hpegl_vmaas_load_balancer_monitor` resource supports NSX-T Load balancer Monitor creation.

For creating an NSX-T Load balancer Monitor, use the following examples.

## Example usage for creating NSX-T Load balancer Monitor for HTTP with all possible attributes

```terraform
# (C) Copyright 2022 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP

# HTTP Monitor
resource "hpegl_vmaas_load_balancer_monitor" "tf_HTTP_MONITOR" {
  lb_id       = data.hpegl_vmaas_load_balancer.tf_lb.id
  name        = "tf_HTTP_MONITOR"
  description = "HTTP_MONITOR creating using tf"
  type        = "LBHttpMonitorProfile"
  http_monitor {
    fall_count            = 8
    interval              = 10
    monitor_port          = 50
    rise_count            = 5
    timeout               = 30
